subtitle: Close a Loophole for Avoiding the Mitigation Fee through Property Line Manipulation 
from: Councilmembers Harrison, Robinson, and Hahn 
---

Refer to the Planning Commission an amendment to BMC Section 23C.12.020 (Inclusionary Housing Requirements - Applicability of Regulations) to close a loophole allowing prospective project applicants to avoid inclusionary affordable housing requirements for owner occupied projects by modifying property lines so that no lot is large enough to construct five or more units. Adopt an updated resolution pursuant to BMC 22.20.065 (Affordable Housing Mitigation Fee) addressing the same issue for rental projects.
