That the Council adds six permanent positions to the Transportation Division as part of the city’s fiscal year 2020-2021 biennial budget by referring $1,433,310.40 to the budget process to fund these positions; the total cost of salaries without benefits is 863,440; the total cost of benefits alone is 569,870.40. These positions should include 4 Engineers, a permanent Senior Planner (to coordinate Vision Zero), and an Administrative Professional. The Transportation Division needs increased staff capacity to deliver funded capital projects and work towards the City’s Vision Zero goal of eliminating fatal and severe injury collisions.
