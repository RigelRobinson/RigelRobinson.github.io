Refer to the City Manager to develop a comprehensive ordinance governing a Bicycle Lane and Pedestrian Street Improvements Policy that would:

1. Require simultaneous implementation of recommendations in the City&rsquo;s Bicycle and Pedestrian Plans when City streets are repaved, if one or more of the following conditions are met: (a) Bicycle Plan recommendations can be implemented using quick-build strategies that accommodate transit operations. (b) Pedestrian Plan recommendations can be implemented using quick-build strategies that accommodate transit operations. (c) The Bicycle Plan recommends studying protected bike lanes as part of a Complete Street Corridor Study in the Tier 1 Priority list. (d) Improvements are necessary to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
2. Prioritize bikeways and Vision Zero high-fatality, high-collision streets under the five-year Paving Plan by requiring that 50 percent of the repaving budget go towards such streets until they meet a minimum surface standard established with input from the Public Works and Transportation Commissions.
3. Encourage the use of quick builds by expediting quick-build projects under $1 million. (a)&ldquo;Quick-build&rdquo; is defined as projects that a) require non-permanent features such as bollards/paint/bus boarding islands, b) make up less than 25 percent of the total repaving cost for that street segment, and c) can be a component of a Complete Street Corridor Study that includes evaluation after installation.
4. Require staff to report progress back to Council every two years.

Furthermore, refer to the City Manager to draft a revised version of the City&rsquo;s Complete Streets Policy that would clarify that the presence of an existing or planned bikeway parallel to an arterial does not exempt projects along said arterial from bicycle and micromobility improvements under the Policy.
