1. Refer to the Transportation Commission a draft ordinance amending Berkeley Municipal Code Chapter (BMC) 14.56.070 to prohibit commercial trucks exceeding three tons gross vehicle weight from utilizing streets comprising the bicycle boulevards network. 
2. Refer to the City Manager to update BMC 14.56.070 as more Berkeley streets become Bicycle Boulevards, as outlined in the 2017 Bicycle Plan.
