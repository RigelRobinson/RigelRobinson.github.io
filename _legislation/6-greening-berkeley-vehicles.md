Request the City Manager and Department of Public Works collaborate to create an Action Plan (“plan”), by June 2020, to aggressively accelerate the implementation of the electrification of the City’s municipal fleet and phase out fossil fuel use in municipal vehicles by 2030 with consideration of an earlier transition for light-duty passenger vehicles. The Plan should include an evaluation of the City’s current fleet and an analysis of opportunities for transitioning to a fleet of fossil fuel free vehicles, as soon as the technology can safely meet operational needs. An update on our progress should be reported to City Council as an information item every six months. 

In the interim, the City Manager is asked to explain criteria used to purchase fossil fuel vehicles in all future staff items related to vehicle purchases with Council.
