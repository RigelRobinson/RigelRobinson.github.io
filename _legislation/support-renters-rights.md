Send a letter supporting SB 529, and AB 36, 724, 1481, and 1482 to their respective authors, which would strengthen tenant organizing rights, allow rent control on certain units, provide caps for annual rent increases, protect against wrongful evictions, and create a registry of all California rental units.
