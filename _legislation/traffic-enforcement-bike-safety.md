1. Refer to the Transportation Commission to consider a Resolution deprioritizing enforcement of the Idaho Stop and Dead Red conventions for persons operating a bicycle, after the operator has yielded to any other road users with the right of way, by prohibiting the use of any City funds or resources in assisting in the enforcement or issuance of citations for bicyclist violations of California Vehicle Code Sections 22450(a) and 21453(a).
2. Refer to the City Manager to develop a ticket diversion program to educate bicyclists as an alternative to monetary fines related to other infractions, and to ensure integration of Vision Zero principles in implementation of state Office of Traffic Safety grants.
3. Refer to the City Manager to develop a plan to calm and divert motor vehicle traffic on bicycle boulevards to provide people who bicycle and walk a safe, comfortable and convenient mobility experience by adding or reconfiguring stop signage and other traffic calming measures, per the recommendations of the 2017 Bicycle Plan.
