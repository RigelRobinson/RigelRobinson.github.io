Refer to the City Manager to:
1. Develop and return to Council with a procedural and financial plan to modify all appropriate City forms to include an optional field for personal gender pronouns (she/her, he/him, they/them, and space to specify other).
2. Develop and return to Council with a procedural and financial plan to revise the Berkeley Municipal Code to replace all instances of gendered pronouns with the singular “they,” and amend Sections 1.04.020, 4.36.110, 4.38.110, 4.39.110, and 11.08.050 regarding grammatical interpretation to indicate that whenever a gender neutral personal pronoun is used, it shall be deemed to include the feminine and masculine also.
