Adopt a resolution in support of the Good Food Purchasing Programâ€™s core values and join San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles and Chicago as one of the first five cities nationwide to become a Good Food Purchasing partner, and refer to the City Manager to incorporate over time the vision and standards of the Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP) into City of Berkeley food purchasing practices.
