Refer to the City Manager to bring back to Council a report of potential revisions to the zoning code to foster a broader range of housing types across Berkeley, particularly missing middle housing types (duplexes, triplexes/fourplexes, courtyard apartments, bungalow courts, townhouses, etc.), in areas with access to essential components of livability like parks, schools, employment, transit, and other services.  

Report should include, but is not limited to:
- Identifying where missing middle housing is optimal/should be permitted.
- Allowing the possibility of existing houses/footprints/zoning envelopes to be divided up to 4 units.
- Excluding very high fire severity zones as defined by the CalFire and/or the City of Berkeley.
