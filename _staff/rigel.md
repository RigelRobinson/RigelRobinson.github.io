For as long as he has called this place home, City Councilmember Rigel Robinson has been fighting for progressive change for Berkeley. On November 6th, 2018, at 22, Rigel was elected to the Berkeley City Council, becoming the youngest City Councilmember in the history of the city.

Though Rigel was raised in St. Louis, Missouri, UC Berkeley — the alma mater of his great-grandmother — was his dream school. Just three months into his first year on campus, Rigel led a protest of more than a thousand students in opposition to the proposed 2014 tuition hikes. At the end of his sophomore year, Rigel was elected to serve as a senator with the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC), where he advocated for more student housing as chair of the Real Estate Student Board, and worked with environmental groups to successfully push the UC Regents to divest from the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Rigel was soon elected to serve as the ASUC’s External Affairs Vice President, responsible for advocating on behalf of the 40,000 students of UC Berkeley. Rigel also served as the University Affairs Chair of the systemwide University of California Student Association. Under Rigel’s leadership, students successfully delayed a proposed tuition hike, protested a UC Regent accused of sexual harassment until he resigned, galvanized students around the closure of the Alta Bates Medical Center, and negotiated the first decrease in student fees across the UC system in twenty years.

On Berkeley City Council, Rigel has prioritized affordable housing development, improved public transit options, and the revitalization of Telegraph Avenue. Rigel sits on the 4x4 Joint Task Force Committee on Housing, the 4x6 City/UC/Student Relations Committee, the Public Safety Committee, and the Facilities, Infrastructure, Transportation, Environment & Sustainability Committee. He is the City of Berkeley’s alternate to the League of California Cities - East Bay Division.
