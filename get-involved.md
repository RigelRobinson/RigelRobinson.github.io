### City Commissions

The City of Berkeley has over thirty-five Boards and Commissions composed of more than 350 members of the public as Commissioners. Membership changes frequently and Berkeley residents are encouraged to check the Commissioner Roster for the most current information regarding vacancies. Applications for any commission may be submitted for consideration at any time. Generally, each Councilmember makes one appointment per commission. With few exceptions, commissioners must reside in Berkeley.

Learn more about each commission on [the City of Berkeley Boards & Commissions page](https://www.cityofberkeley.info/commissions/).

To apply to be appointed to a City Commission, contact the Councilmember who has a vacancy on that commission with a completed application and affidavit of residency. And if you really want to impress them, a cover letter.

### Advocacy

There are a variety of key advocacy organizations & stakeholder groups that influence city legislation by attending city council meetings, writing to the council, or lobbying councilmembers directly. Pick one that suits your interests, and get to work!

For neighbors and residents, we recommend you join your local neighborhood association, and for students, we recommend you get involved with the student government, the ASUC. You can always email the entire City Council with your thoughts at [council@cityofberkeley.info](council@cityofberkeley.info). And be sure to follow #berkmtg on Twitter!

### Internships

Thank you for your interest in serving the City of Berkeley in the Office of Councilmember Rigel Robinson!
 
This fall, our office will host one Intern and multiple Volunteer Fellows. Thanks to a budget referral that our office passed this year, we are now able to fund one paid intern. The office intern is stipended $500 for the semester and expected to work a minimum of 10 hours a week. Fellows are unpaid, and expected to work between 4 and 8 hours a week.

DO NOT HESITATE TO APPLY FOR THE PAID POSITION! If you are applying for the Internship, tell us both how your skills will benefit the office and how the stipend will benefit you. When deciding whether to apply for the Internship or a Fellowship, please reflect on whether you need the stipend. The $500 is intended to expand accessibility of policy experience to low income students. If you apply for the paid Internship position and do not receive it, you will still be fully and equally considered for a volunteer position as a Fellow. Need and merit will both be considered when awarding the Internship.

Regardless of the position for which you are applying, please upload a cover letter, resume, and writing sample through this from. Please highlight your policy, organizing, and/or constituency services experience. Your writing sample should be a policy memo, op-ed piece, essay or something comparable.
