### City Commissions

The City of Berkeley has over thirty-five Boards and Commissions composed of more than 350 members of the public as Commissioners. Membership changes frequently and Berkeley residents are encouraged to check the Commissioner Roster for the most current information regarding vacancies. Applications for any commission may be submitted for consideration at any time. Generally, each Councilmember makes one appointment per commission. With few exceptions, commissioners must reside in Berkeley.

Learn more about each commission on [the City of Berkeley Boards & Commissions page](https://www.cityofberkeley.info/commissions/).

To apply to be appointed to a City Commission, contact the Councilmember who has a vacancy on that commission with a completed application and affidavit of residency. And if you really want to impress them, a cover letter.

### Internships

The spring internship program is closed. Check again soon for updates as we open applications for the summer internship program.

Candidates of all backgrounds are welcome to apply, so long as they are passionate about progressive policymaking and the future of the City of Berkeley. Intern tasks include policy research, office management, constituent services, community organizing, and more.

To apply, please send a resume and a cover letter to [RRobinson@CityofBerkeley.info](mailto:rrobinson@cityofberkeley.info) with "Spring Internship - (Your Name)" in the subject line. Your cover letter is an opportunity for you to describe your career and academic goals, your interest in the City of Berkeley and local government, policy ideas to improve the City of Berkeley, and your availability during the course of the internship.

Time commitment for interns is a flexible 4-10 hours per week. Hours are between 9:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. every weekday at the City of Berkeley Central Administrative Offices at 2180 Milvia Street, fifth floor. Submissions will be accepted until positions are filled.
