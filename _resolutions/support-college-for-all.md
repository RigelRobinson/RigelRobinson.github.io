That the Mayor and Berkeley City Councilmembers support Senate Bill 806 (S.806) otherwise known as the College for All Act of 2017 and write a letter of support to Rep. Bernard Sanders and cosponsors of the bill. Senate Bill 806 would forgive over $1.6 trillion of student loan debts, thereby releasing over 45 million Americans from student debt.
