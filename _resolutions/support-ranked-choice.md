Send a letter to Assemblymember Allen supporting SB 212, which would authorize a city, county, or local educational agency to conduct an election using ranked choice voting, and SB 641, which would authorize the Governor to require a special election to fill a vacancy in a congressional or legislative office using rank choice voting, if the jurisdiction is capable of using this voting method.
